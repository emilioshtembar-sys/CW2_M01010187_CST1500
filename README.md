## Week 7 Secure Authentication System for Security & File Persistence (Hashing)
## Project Description 
This is a secure authentication system  with hashing,which i have designed for week 7.
 The aim is to allow users to register theur accounts and to log in. 
 The project consists of 2 main flies which are Main.py and auth.py
## Features
secure password hasing is carreied out thrpugh the import bcrypt FUNCTION.
there was a menu that presents the user  with three option register user, login user,  and exit. File-based user data persistence is enable by.
Password login included password verification when a password was entered to see if it was valid. inpit validation was used for both the username and password was used to ensure that the valid username and passwords were entered. 
here is an output example of the user login system for registration, login and  and it is working coorectly
1. Register User
2. Login User
3. Exit
Choose an option: 3
Exiting program.
Enter username: Emilio
Enter password: Magic123#
User 'Emilio' registered successfully.

1. Register Usergv 
2. Login User
3. Exit
Choose an option: 2
Enter username: Emilio
Enter password: Magic123#
Login successful.

1. Register User
2. Login User
3. Exit
Choose an option: 3
Exiting program.





## Technical implementation  
I hads to install bccrypt, as it was not previoulsy installed in order for the registration system to run, otherwise it would nor run without it. The Hashing Algorithm is powered by bcrypt with automatic salting which allows identical passwods to procues diffrent hashes, and prevents potienal attackers from using precomputed hash tables, and it allows for unique password protection for every user of the system.
Data storage for the  plain text file is carried out by the plain text file 
Input validation is carried out for usernames and passwords. 
As stated in the brief I put the menu and main in the main.py file as it made it simpler and made sure that the file was less cluttered.
